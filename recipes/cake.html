        <h2>Carrot Cake Recipe</h2>
        <p>This carrot cake is my favorite recipe, and I have tried many carrot cakes! If you don't like pecans, feel free to leave them out.</p>
        <p>Our top-rated carrot cake recipe is moist, light, fluffy, and topped with a rich cream cheese frosting. What's not to love?</p>

        <h2>What's In Carrot Cake?</h2>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make your new go-to carrot cake recipe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sugars</strong>: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon</strong>: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Carrots</strong>: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
            <li><strong>Pecans</strong>: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong> and <strong>cream cheese</strong>: Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Make Carrot Cake Step-By-Step</h2>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade carrot cake:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the batter</strong>: Beat the wet ingredients together, then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir in the carrots and fold in the pecans.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the cake</strong>: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li><strong>Frost the cake</strong>: Beat the frosting ingredients together until smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans. Frost the (completely cooled) cake.</li>
        </ol>
